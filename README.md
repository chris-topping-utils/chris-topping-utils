Hi!

I'm Chris, an IT professional with a background in Service Delivery. My key focus here is to collate Powershell scripts that I've found useful in resolving escalated helpdesk tickets and automating boring stuff.

I'll also be uploading study notes for any certification exams I've passed to hopefully assist others attempting to upskill.
